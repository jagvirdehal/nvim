# nvim [WIP]

This is my neovim setup that I'm working on building from the ground up. It's
particularly created with the goal to be very slim and fast enough to work in a
monorepo. I have also made sure to separate the plugins into several files to
make it easier to understand and configure.

My goal is to make it at least as good as the previous kickstart fork
(`jagvirdehal/neovim`) but take in some inspiration from the LazyVim distro for
more feature-richness.

Building from the ground up will allow me to make more specific tweaks and have
the know-how to eliminate some headache I've experienced with other neovim
setups.
